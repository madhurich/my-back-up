ROUTING IN ANGULAR2
To enable routing the three things we need to do are
1. include the 'router' script in the index.html
2. specify the <base href="/"> (this depends on from where you launch)
3. import 'ROUTER_PROVIDERS' from 'angular2/router'
4. specify this 'ROUTER_PROVIDERS' in the array after bootstraping
bootstrap(AppComponent, [ROUTER_PROVIDERS]) in boot.ts file

TO CONFIGURE ROUTES
import {RouteConfig} from 'angular2/router';

RouteConfig([
	{path: '/albums', name: 'Albums', component: AlbumsComponent, useAsDefault: true},
	{path: '/*other', name: 'Other', redirectTo: ['Albums']}

])



------IMPERATIVE ROUTING--------------
to have imperative routing, i.e when we want to redirect to certian component,
we cna do that using 'routerLink' as well but with imperative routing we can directly have acces to 
router object. 

to do imperative routing, from which component you want to redirect, in that component you need to do
import {Router} from 'angular2/router';
