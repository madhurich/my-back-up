when ever a directove is created, and isolate scope is added to it,
when angular compiles it, it adds a class called ng-isolate-scope
and aslo we can use a method called 'isolateScope()' upon this element
    check in console   
        angular.element(document.querySelector('my-comp'))
                .isolateScope(); //gives you an object.
'my-comp'

Ex:
<my-comp class="ng-isolate-scope"></my-comp>

this is actullay used in debugging purposes, but during production
or deployment, this adds more load to the DOM since we dont use it
in production, so we can disable this using a method called
debugInfoEnabled(false) available in $compileProvider inside of the config
function.

This removes the class added by angular after compilation.

check it in chrome console.
But still if you want to have these clasess to check in production if any
issue occurs, then in the chrome console, check 
    angular.reloadWithDebugInfo()// then this again adds in the class to the element
    'my-comp'.
